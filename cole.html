    <h1>Gerrit Cole for Cy Young 2023</h1>
    <p>Gerrit Cole's case for the Cy Young Award this year is compelling for several reasons. He has consistently demonstrated incredible control, striking out batters at an impressive rate while maintaining the lowest ERA (Earned Run Average) in the American League.</p>
    <p>The Cy Young Award is voted on by members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). The award is given annually to the best pitchers in Major League Baseball, one for the best pitcher in the American League and another for the best pitcher in the National League.</p>

    <h2>Reasons the BBWAA should vote Cole for Cy Young</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>He throws gas</li>
        <li>Best ERA in the AL</li>
        <li>Most games started in the AL</li>
        
    
    </ul>
